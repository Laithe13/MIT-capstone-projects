Automatic Malaria parasite detection from Red Blood Cell images using convolutional neural network

Introduction

Malaria epidemic cause many victims every year because identification and treatment of infected population comes too late. The detection of the Plasmodium parasite responsible for this disease in blood plays a crucial role in the control of the epidemic and in the effectiveness of the treatment. In this In this study, we propose  to build a classification algorithm based on convolutional neural network in order to detect the presence of the Plasmodium parasite in red blood cell images. 

Conclusion

In this study, we present a machine learning model to detect the presence of Malaria parasite in red blood cell images. Convolutional neural network has been used to resolve this classification problem. Geometric data augmentation has improved the quantity and quality of data. The accuracy of this model is 0.988. In view of this excellent performance, this machine learning model could help to improve the speed and reliability of the diagnosis of patient suspected of being infected by malaria.
